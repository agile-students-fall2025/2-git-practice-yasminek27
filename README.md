# [Can AI really code? Study maps the roadblocks to autonomous software engineering](https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716)
I found this article interesting because it highlights an issue that many software engineers or people looking into the field are worried about. Many people think that AI is going to take over every job and field however, this article highlights the aspects that AI can not replicate. For example, there is a lot of rewriting and reshaping code in order to fit any new guidlines or project outcomes that arise. They also raise the issue of communication between AI and humans run a very fine line where the user will try to communicate how to get a task done and they feel as if they do not have enough control of the response AI gives. They continue to provide more reasonings as to why AI is not going to take over automation for software engineers any time soon unless we address the holes in AI.
